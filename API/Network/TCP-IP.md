### How TCP/ IP works?

- TCP/IP employs the client-server demonstration of communication in which a client or machine (a client) is given a benefit (like sending a webpage) by another computer (a server) within the network.
- Collectively, the TCP/IP suite of conventions is classified as stateless, which suggests each client request is considered new since it is irrelevant to past requests. Being stateless liberates up network paths so they can be utilized continuously.
- The transport layer itself, is stateful. It transmits a single message, and its connection remains open until all the packets in a message have been received and reassembled at the destination.
- The TCP/IP model differs from the seven-layer Open System Interconnection (OSI) model designed after it.
### TCP/IP Layers

- **Application Layer** An application layer is the topmost layer within the TCP/IP model. When one application layer protocol needs to communicate with another application layer, it forwards its information to the transport layer.
- **Transport Layer** It is responsible for the reliability, flow control, and correction of data that is being sent over the network. There are two protocols used in this layer are User Datagram Protocol and Transmission control protocol.
- **Internet/Network Layer** It is the third layer of the TCP/IP Model and also known as the Network layer. The main responsibility of this layer is to send the packets from any network, and they arrive at the goal irrespective of the route they take.
- **Network Access Layer** It is the lowest layer of the TCP/IP Model. It is the combination of the Physical Layer and the Data link layer which present in the OSI Model. Its main responsibility is to the transmission of information over the same network between two devices.
